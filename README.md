# Competition Among Random Agents on a Discrete Torus

This constitutes some of the artifacts for the work I did in Fall 2021 through the Illinois Geometry Lab at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Thanks to professors Partha S. Dey and Daesung Kim, team leader Grigory Terlov, and fellow undergraduate researchers Mingqi Wang and Tianyi Wang. Support for this project was provided by the Illinois Geometry Lab.
